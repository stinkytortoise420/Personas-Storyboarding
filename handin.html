                <p class="caption"> The Coca-cola freestyle machine is shaped like a simple rectangular prism. The front of the machine consists
                     of two important parts: the drink slot and the touchscreen. By interacting with the touchscreen, users may
                      select the drink they want to pour. Icons that are colored gray signify that the machine is out of that 
                      kind of drink. You can filter the drinks on the default screen (or “menu”) by touching one of the four 
                      buttons on the bottom of the touchscreen. Once the user selects a drink, they will be taken to the next 
                      screen. Here, they can select different flavors of the drink and view nutritional information. After 
                      they have made a selection, the user must then push the lever on the right with their cup in hand to 
                      start pouring. They can also fill their cup with ice if they press it against the lever on the left. 
                      Lastly, there is a virtual pouring option if the user scans the QR code on the default screen. This 
                      allows them to control the pouring from their phone. The user would still have to hold their cup under 
                      the fountain if they do this, but they wouldn’t have to press the lever.</p>

                <ul class="questions">
                    <li>What drink did you get?</li>
                    <li>Did you get any ice?</li>
                    <li>Did you filter your drink options on screen before making a selection?</li>
                    <li>Is the drink as good as the last time you had it?</li>
                    <li>Was this your first choice of drink?</li>
                    <li>How long did it take for you to get to the front of the drink line?</li>
                    <li>How would you compare this machine to the one in the ivy room?</li>
                    <li>On a scale from 1-10 (1 being easiest, 10 being hardest), how difficult was it to select the drink you wanted?</li>
                    <li>Do you keep track of how many calories are in your drink?</li>
                    <li>How do you envision that this machine works?</li>
                    <li>Have you ever used the virtual pour option?</li>

                <h1 class="p2-head">Part 2: Observations</h1>
                <p class="caption">Most of the students were able to get their first drink of choice without any difficulty 
                    or hesitation. Several students grabbed two cups at once and were able to fill both of them up quickly. 
                    All of the students I observed picked their drink directly from the default screen, without using any of 
                    the filtering options. At one point, a dining worker opened the compartment to the right of the touchscreen 
                    and started refilling the flavors. However, the compartments weren’t opening properly and the touchscreen 
                    became unresponsive. After a while, a different worker came by and rebooted the machine, which fixed it.</p>
                <h1 class="answers-head">Takeaways from the Interviews</h1>
                <ul class="questions">
                    <li>Two students got their drink of choice, and one did not.</li>
                    <li>None of the students used the filtering options before selecting their drink. However, one claimed 
                        that they have used them before. Also, none had ever used the virtual pour feature.</li>
                    <li>All students responded that the machine was very easy to use. To be more precise, all said that on a 
                        scale from 1 to 10 (10 being hardest), this machine had a difficulty of 1.</li>
                    <li>Two of the students claimed that this machine is better than the one in the ivy room. One mentioned 
                        that it’s “more accessible.”</li>
                    <li>Students generally believed that the machine stores drinks and flavors separately. Two of them also 
                        thought that there was some moving part in the machine that would adjust based on the selection that was 
                        made.</li>
                    <li>The dining worker who was trying to repair the machine mentioned that just like a computer, it’s 
                        prone to viruses and slowdowns.</li>
                    <li>All students interviewed mentioned that they wanted the interview to be quick.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="caption">This student is in a rush. They are busy with classes, work, and other responsibilities
                    and want to limit their time at the Ratty. They would not appreciate it if there was a line, if their 
                    first choice of drink was out, or if the machine was out of order entirely. It's mostly Brown students
                    using these machines, and like this persona, many of them are stressed or in a hurry.

                <p class="caption">This is a dining worker at Brown. They are super busy and must handle many different 
                    responsibilities, one of which is restocking the drink machine. If the drink machine's touchscreen becomes
                    unresponsive or one of the cartridges refuses to open, then the machine has to be rebooted before the worker
                    can restock.
